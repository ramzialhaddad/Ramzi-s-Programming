# Terminal CRT Effect

![Well you were supposed to have a GIF here, so I guess try to reload the page?](/readmeimagesandstuffswhyareyoureadingthis/demo.gif)

This was basically made to demonstrate how CRTs work, for an upcoming video.

# How it works

It is super simple all you need is a 2 Dimensional Array with values of 0 or 1 inside them and call the function with the array passed inside it. I've made some examples in the code and even a simple shape along side a blank 10x10 "pixel" 2d array which you can make your own stuff from.

So it loops through the 2d array given and draws each "pixel" one by one, simulating a real CRT with an electron beam

# How to run

 To execute run ```py main.py```

You can also change the value of the ```hertz``` variable to speed up or slowdown the "CRT"

 For best results make your font size in Terminal or Console to the minimum. I also prefer to make the window 80 x 25 on CMD, you do not have to do this.

# The TODO list

All the stuff to make this better as a demonstration are on the issues tab of this repository, if you have an idea on how to make this better open up an issue!
